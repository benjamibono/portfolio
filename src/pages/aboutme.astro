              <p>
                I grew up in Spain with a natural aptitude for learning and problem-solving. After high school, 
                I explored Switzerland—where my father had built his life—and immediately connected with the 
                culture of precision, innovation, and quality. The landscapes, the work ethic, and the 
                international environment felt like home.
              </p>
              <p>
                I pursued Business Administration and Finance, then Economics and E-commerce, gaining valuable 
                business acumen. But I was searching for something more technical, more creative, more impactful. 
                I needed to find where my analytical mind and drive for excellence could truly shine.

                Building Business Acumen 📈
              </h2>
              <p>
                Before discovering programming, I honed my leadership and operational skills in the real world. 
                I entered the hospitality industry and quickly progressed from delivery driver to managing the 
                largest store in the region, transforming it into the most profitable location in the country.
              </p>
              <p>
                This experience taught me how to drive results under pressure, optimize operations, lead teams, 
                and deliver measurable business impact. I learned that success comes from combining strategic 
                thinking with hands-on execution—lessons that now inform how I approach technical leadership.

                Transition to Tech 💻
              </h2>
              <p>
                In April 2020, I discovered programming. What started as curiosity quickly became a passion. 
                I taught myself Python, JavaScript, React, TypeScript, and modern web technologies through 
                intensive self-study—Codecademy, YouTube, Scrimba, and LeetCode became my university.
              </p>
              <p>
                Within months, I was building production applications for clients. I delivered 20+ full-stack 
                projects—from e-commerce platforms to AI-powered apps—each one pushing my technical boundaries. 
                I learned to ship fast, iterate based on feedback, and deliver real business value.
              </p>
              <p>
                By 2025, I had proven myself as a full-stack developer capable of handling complex projects 
                independently. This track record led to my current role as Tech Lead at 21 Impact Labs, where 
                I now lead platform development, mentor engineers, and drive technical strategy for a health-tech 
                startup in Zurich.

                Technical Leadership Today 🚀
              </h2>
              <p>
                As Tech Lead at 21 Impact Labs, I own the full technical lifecycle of the xponetiq Premium 
                platform—from architecture decisions to production deployments. I lead MVP execution, coordinate 
                with product and iOS teams, manage AWS infrastructure, and ensure delivery quality through CI/CD 
                pipelines and monitoring.
              </p>
              <p>
                My multilingual abilities (Spanish, Catalan, English, German, French, Italian) enable seamless 
                collaboration in international teams. I combine technical depth with business acumen, translating 
                product requirements into executable technical plans while mentoring engineers and unblocking delivery.
              </p>
              <p>
                I thrive in fast-paced environments where I can drive both technical excellence and business impact. 
                Whether it's architecting scalable systems, optimizing team workflows, or shipping features under 
                tight deadlines, I deliver results.

              <p>
                I'm motivated by complex technical challenges and the opportunity to create meaningful impact. 
                Whether it's architecting a new platform feature, optimizing system performance, or mentoring 
                junior engineers, I approach every challenge with strategic thinking and execution excellence.
              </p>
              <p>
                My background in business operations gives me a unique perspective—I don't just build features, 
                I build solutions that drive business outcomes. I understand stakeholder needs, can translate 
                requirements into technical plans, and deliver on aggressive timelines without compromising quality.
              </p>
              <p>
                Based in Zurich, I'm fortunate to work at the intersection of health-tech and innovation. 
                I'm always interested in connecting with other technical leaders, exploring new opportunities, 
                and contributing to projects that push the boundaries of what's possible.
