              <p>
                From an early age, I was identified as having high IQ, but in my hometown,
                opportunities were very limited. I was an excellent student in high school, but upon
                graduating, I felt lost and directionless, with no one to guide me. Facing
                uncertainty and limited opportunities in my city, I decided to try my luck in
                Switzerland, where my father had been living, working, and happily married (now a
                Swiss citizen) for years.
              </p>
              <p>
                I felt it was where I belonged: security, opportunities, spectacular landscapes, and
                gorgeous cities. I fell in love with snowboarding and, above all, with the culture
                of work, effort, and social life, where others are respected and cared for. However,
                I needed a degree and something to dedicate myself to. At that time, I didn't master
                German well, and although I worked as an au pair and in temporary employment, I
                wouldn't be able to fulfill myself or prosper professionally.
              </p>
              <p>
                I returned to Spain and studied Business Administration and Finance, but I didn't
                feel fulfilled with it. I also tried Economics and E-commerce, searching for
                direction, but I still hadn't found my passion. It was during this time that I began
                to shape my professional path through hands-on experience.

                Professional Growth üìà
              </h2>
              <p>
                At that point, I considered returning to Switzerland, but I needed money. I didn't
                want to depend on anyone in Spain or Switzerland, so I entered the hospitality
                industry. During the probation period, I was already made permanent, and within
                months, I went from being a delivery driver to managing the largest store in the
                area. It soon became the most profitable store in the country.
              </p>
              <p>
                After achieving this, a family contact offered me a position at a dental clinic.
                They needed an aesthetic renovation, a website, an inventory system, better
                organization of materials, schedules, patient appointments, billing, and files, all
                with a very limited budget. It was a huge challenge for someone so young, but I knew
                I was capable. They told me they needed someone disciplined, organized, resourceful,
                and charismatic, so I accepted.
              </p>
              <p>
                Until March 2025, when I trained my successor, the clinic went from being in the
                red, with long waiting times, worker dissatisfaction, and organizational chaos, to
                having full schedules three weeks in advance, a 5/5 rating on Google, up-to-date
                invoices, higher net profits, a renewed image, a custom website, and new
                organization methods to ensure its long-term operation. We made it!

                Discovery of Programming üíª
              </h2>
              <p>
                Although I started learning programming out of curiosity, in April 2020 I began
                accepting projects to supplement my income from hospitality and the clinic. I worked
                on it on weekends and holidays, and there I discovered my passion: time flew by, I
                created useful things for people, and they valued my work.
              </p>
              <p>
                I started with Python, then HTML/CSS/JS, and later React, TypeScript, and Tailwind.
                I learned SQL, Git, Node.js, Next.js, Figma, and Docker. Each new technology was a
                challenge that motivated me to give my best and reach my full potential. I'm
                self-taught: I used Codecademy and YouTube for theory, and Scrimba and LeetCode for
                practice.
              </p>
              <p>
                Today, I'm at my best moment. I'm not a master yet, but with current tools and AI, I
                learn and create much faster. Problems that used to take me weeks now take days with
                planning and study. My technical portfolio includes both public projects on GitHub
                and private work for government and private entities.

                Skills & Languages üåç
              </h2>
              <p>
                My multilingual abilities set me apart: I'm fluent in Spanish, Catalan, and English,
                with B1+ proficiency in French and German, though the latter is my priority as it's
                the language of business and key to my career. This linguistic diversity, combined
                with strong communication skills, enables effective collaboration in international
                environments.
              </p>
              <p>
                I've always been good at communication, my charisma and extroversion, and my passion
                for reading have led me to leadership roles in sports, studies, and work. Beyond
                technical expertise, I bring a relentless drive for learning and problem-solving. My
                experience in leadership roles has honed my ability to inspire and guide teams and
                colleagues toward success. I thrive in challenging environments and maintain a
                disciplined approach to achieving goals.

              <p>
                I'm in Switzerland because I fit in with the culture and work environment. I want to
                start a family with my partner and, like my father, become a Swiss citizen after
                much effort. In this country, opportunities are abundant, and nature is always
                nearby.
              </p>
              <p>
                I'm now ready to contribute to innovative projects in a dynamic environment. My
                commitment to continuous growth drives me to expand my expertise in full-stack
                development, whether through mastering new programming languages, optimizing system
                architecture, or enhancing user experiences.
              </p>
              <p>
                I've always succeeded in what I set out to do: sports, studies, work. I just need an
                opportunity to maximize my talent: discipline and ambition. I'm prepared for
                immediate relocation and welcome on-site opportunities. My track record of success
                in diverse roles, combined with my technical skills and cultural adaptability,
                positions me to make immediate and lasting contributions to any team.
