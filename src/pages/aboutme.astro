              <p>
                From an early age, I was identified as having high IQ, but in my hometown,
                opportunities were very limited. I was an excellent student in high school, but upon
                graduating, I felt lost and directionless, with no one to guide me. Facing
                uncertainty and limited opportunities in my city, I decided to try my luck in
                Switzerland, where my father had been living, working, and happily married (now a
                Swiss citizen) for years.
              </p>
              <p>
                I felt it was where I belonged: security, opportunities, spectacular landscapes, and
                gorgeous cities. I fell in love with snowboarding and, above all, with the culture
                of work, effort, and social life, where others are respected and cared for. However,
                I needed a degree and something to dedicate myself to. At that time, I didn't master
                German well, and although I worked as an au pair and in temporary employment, I
                wouldn't be able to fulfill myself or prosper professionally.
              </p>
              <p>
                I returned to Spain and studied Business Administration and Finance, but I didn't
                feel fulfilled with it. I also tried Economics and E-commerce, searching for
                direction, but I still hadn't found my passion. It was during this time that I began
                to shape my professional path through hands-on experience.

                Professional Growth üìà
              </h2>
              <p>
                                 At that point, I considered returning to Switzerland, but I needed financial independence. 
                 Rather than depending on anyone, I entered the hospitality industry with determination. 
                 During my probation period, I was already made permanent, and within months, I went from 
                 delivery driver to managing the largest store in the area, transforming it into the most 
                 profitable location in the entire country.
              </p>
              <p>
                                 This success opened doors. A family contact offered me a position at a struggling dental clinic 
                 that needed <strong>everything</strong>: aesthetic renovation, a modern website, inventory management, 
                 better organization, streamlined scheduling, and billing systems, all on a shoestring budget. 
                 It was an enormous challenge for someone so young, but I knew I had the vision and tenacity to succeed.
              </p>
              <p>
                The transformation was remarkable. By March 2025, when I trained my successor, we had achieved 
                the impossible: turned a failing clinic into a thriving business with full schedules booked 
                3 weeks in advance, a perfect 5/5 Google rating, streamlined operations, significantly higher 
                profits, and a completely renewed image. <strong>We didn't just save the clinic‚Äîwe revolutionized it.</strong>

                Discovery of Programming üíª
              </h2>
              <p>
                                 <strong>The moment everything changed.</strong> What started as curiosity in April 2020 became 
                 an obsession. I began accepting programming projects to supplement my income, working weekends 
                 and holidays. But this wasn't just work: <em>this was my calling</em>. Time became irrelevant 
                 when I was coding. I was creating solutions that genuinely helped people, and they valued what I built.
              </p>
              <p>
                                 My learning journey was intense and self-directed: Python first, then HTML/CSS/JavaScript, 
                 followed by React, TypeScript, and Tailwind. I mastered SQL, Git, Node.js, Next.js, Figma, 
                 and Docker. Each technology was a new mountain to climb, and I loved every challenge. 
                 <strong>Codecademy and YouTube for theory, Scrimba and LeetCode for practice.</strong> I was 
                 completely autodidactic and thrived on it.
              </p>
              <p>
                                 Today, I'm at my peak performance. While I'm still growing, the combination of modern tools 
                 and AI has exponentially accelerated my capabilities. Problems that once took weeks now take 
                 days through strategic planning and focused execution. My portfolio spans from public GitHub 
                 projects to confidential work for government entities and private corporations. 
                 <strong>Each project is a testament to continuous evolution.</strong>

              <p>
                My multilingual abilities set me apart: I'm fluent in Spanish, Catalan, and English,
                with good French and German, though the latter is my priority as it's the language
                of business and key to my career. This linguistic diversity, combined with strong
                communication skills, enables effective collaboration in international environments.

              <p>
                I've always been good at communication, my charisma and extroversion, and my passion
                for reading have led me to leadership roles in sports, studies, and work. Beyond
                technical expertise, I bring a relentless drive for learning and problem-solving. My
                experience in leadership roles has honed my ability to inspire and guide teams and
                colleagues toward success. I thrive in challenging environments and maintain a

              <p>
                                 Switzerland isn't just a destination for me: <strong>it's home</strong>. From the moment I first 
                 arrived, I knew I belonged here. The culture of precision, excellence, and respect resonates 
                 deeply with my values. I fell in love with the spectacular landscapes, the work ethic, and 
                 the way people genuinely care for one another. Following my father's footsteps, who became 
                 a Swiss citizen through dedication and hard work, I'm ready to build my own legacy here.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>This is where I want to start a family with my partner.</strong> This is where I want 
                to contribute to innovative projects that matter. This is where I want to apply my discipline 
                and ambition to create something meaningful. Switzerland offers the perfect environment for 
                continuous growth‚Äîwhether mastering new programming languages, optimizing system architectures, 
                or crafting exceptional user experiences.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>My track record speaks for itself:</strong> I've succeeded in everything I've committed 
                to‚Äîsports, studies, business transformation, and now technology. I don't just complete projects; 
                I exceed expectations. I'm not just looking for a job; I'm seeking the opportunity to maximize 
                my potential and contribute to something greater than myself. 
                <em>Give me that chance, and I'll prove that discipline and ambition can move mountains.</em>
